# DocsifyJS Tutorial - SSR
> Use Server-Side Rendering to make an SEO-friendly version of a DocsifyJS Tutorial


## Base site

Here is the original repo:

- https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-js-tutorial

That is served as a Single-Page Application on Github Pages here:

- https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-js-tutorial/#/


## Approach

This repo was created to make a version of the site above which is rendered server-side using Node.js

The DocsifyJS docs provide a recommendation - publish the site on Vercel. That allows hosting as a free `APP.now.sh` domain.
